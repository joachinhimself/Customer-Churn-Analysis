### Objective of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that accurately identify customer churn based on various factors. By analyzing customer interactions, payment behaviors, and website engagement, the project aims to:

1. **Understand Key Drivers of Churn**: Identify the critical factors influencing customer retention and churn, such as service interactions, payment frequency, time spent on the website, and customer satisfaction metrics.

2. **Develop Predictive Models**: Create and evaluate multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to accurately predict customer churn.

3. **Enhance Customer Retention Strategies**: Utilize the insights gained from the predictive models to inform targeted interventions and strategies aimed at reducing churn and improving customer loyalty.

4. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess and compare the effectiveness of different models, ensuring that the chosen approach provides reliable predictions that can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can help businesses proactively address customer retention challenges and improve overall customer satisfaction.
